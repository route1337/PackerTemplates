Route 1337 Packer Templates
===========================
This repo contains the various packer templates used to generate some of Route 1337's [Vagrant Boxes](https://github.com/route1337/VagrantBoxes)

InstallDisks Directory
----------------------
This directory contains DMG and ISO files, so they can't be checked in to git due to their size and/or licensing restrictions.  
To generate the DMGs/ISOs for macOS systems use the prepare_iso.sh script in iso-prep

Preparing a Mac DMG to go into InstallDisks
-------------------------------------------
These are the steps to prepare a Mac DMG to go into InstallDisks (10.9-10.12)
  1. Download the Installer App from the Mac App Store (Yosemite for example)
  2. Run this command from inside iso-prep: sudo prepare_iso/prepare_iso.sh "/Applications/Install OS X Yosemite.app" out/
  3. Move the DMG from iso-prep/out/ to packer/InstallDisks/ and update the corresponding JSON file
  4. Run this command: packer build $jsonFile

Updating a template
------------
Each template JSON file must be updated if a version number or ISO file name/hash changes.
For example, the Mac templates would need the following changes:
  1. name, version, iso_url, iso_checksum_type, iso_checksum in "variables" section
